My Advent of Code 2025 Challenge
This year I want to learn new language that is Go. Right now, I don't have any side project that would be made from Go.
So I would like to use this opportunity to challenge this year Advent of Code with Go!
If I get struck, I may switch back to use C++ or JS but I'll try my best to stick with Go.

Let's enjoy
